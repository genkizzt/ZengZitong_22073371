# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior in an e-commerce setting, particularly addressing the issue of customer churn. By examining a dataset named "shopping_behavior.csv", we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help in predicting and reducing customer attrition.

## Objectives

- To understand key factors contributing to customer churn in an e-commerce environment.
- To build predictive models using SAS e-Miner to identify customers at high risk of churning.
- To utilize Talend Data Integration and Talend Data Prep for effective data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

## Role of SAS e-Miner

SAS e-Miner plays a crucial role in this project as the primary tool for data mining and advanced analytics. We employ various techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and boosting algorithms to model and predict churn. The insights derived from SAS e-Miner guide strategic decisions to enhance customer retention.

## Role of Talend Data Integration

Talend Data Integration is used for efficiently combining, transforming, and cleaning data from multiple sources. It ensures that the dataset used in SAS e-Miner is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly for optimal analysis results.

## Role of Talend Data Prep

Talend Data Prep is crucial for the initial stages of the project, where data needs to be preprocessed. It helps in refining the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality, which is essential for building reliable predictive models.
